    \brief A view for displaying and editing information about a feature.

    A PopupView can be used to display information for any type that
    implements the PopupSource interface. For example, FeatureLayer
    implements PopupSource. This means that it has a PopupDefinition,
    which defines how the Popup should look for any features in that
    layer.

    An example workflow for displaying a PopupView for a feature in a
    FeatureLayer would be:

    \list
      \li Declare a PopupView and anchor it to a desired location.
      \li Perform an identify operation on a GeoView and select a
      Feature from the identify result.
      \li Create a Popup from the Feature.
      \li Optionally obtain the Popup's PopupDefinition and set the
      title, whether to show attachments, and so on.
      \li Create a PopupManager from the Popup.
      \li Assign the PopupView's \c popupManager property the PopupManager
      created in the previous step.
      \li Call the \c show() method to display the PopupView.
      \li Call the \c dismiss() method to hide the PopupView.
    \endlist

    The PopupView is a QML Item that can be anchored, given to a dialog,
    or positioned using XY screen coordinates. Transform, Transition, and
    other QML animation types can be used to animate the showing and
    dismissing of the view.

    For more information, please see the Popup and PopupManager
    documentation.

    \note Each time a change is made to the Popup, PopupDefinition,
    PopupManager, or any of their properties, the PopupManager must
    be re-set to the PopupView.
