# Augmented Reality toolkit component

The Augmented Reality (AR) toolkit component provides support for ARKit for iOS and
Android apps written using ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt. This documentation
describes the installation and uses of the AR toolkit component.

## Overview

Augmented reality experiences are designed to "augment" the physical world with
virtual content that respects real world scale, position, and orientation of a
device. In the case of Runtime, a `SceneView` object is used to display 3D
geographic AR data as virtual content on top of a camera feed of the real,
physical world.

The AR toolkit component allows quick and easy integration of AR into your
application for a wide variety of scenarios. The toolkit recognizes the
following common patterns for AR:

- **Flyover**: Flyover AR lets you explore a scene using your device as a
window into the virtual world. A typical flyover AR scenario begins with the
sceneâ€™s virtual camera positioned over an area of interest. You can walk around
and reorient the device to focus on specific content in the scene.

- **Tabletop**: Scene content is anchored to a physical surface, appearing as
if the scene were a 3D physical model.

- **World-scale**: Scene content is rendered exactly where it would be in the
physical world as viewed through a device's camera feed. The camera feed
provides physical context to the data content, with data content rendered on
top of that feed. This pattern is used in scenarios ranging from viewing hidden
infrastructure, such as the recorded position of utility lines or pipes below a
street, to displaying waypoints for navigation.

The AR toolkit component is comprised of one class: `ArcGISArView`. This is a
subclass of `QQuickItem`, which contains the functionality needed to display an
AR experience in your application. `ArcGISArView` uses ARKit (iOS) or
ARCore (Android) augmented reality framework to display the live camera feed
and handle real world tracking and synchronization with the Runtime SDK's
`SceneView`. The `ArcGISArView` is responsible for starting and managing an
ARKit or ARCore session. `ArcGISArView` also uses a `LocationDataSource`
for getting an initial GPS location when continuous GPS tracking is required.

For details about using ARKit, please refer to [Apple's
documentation](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality). For ARCore,
please refer to [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/ar/).

ArcGIS Runtime SDK 100.6 for Qt 100.6 is required to use this toolkit
component.

### Features of the AR toolkit component

- Allows display of the live camera feed
- Manages ARKit or ARCore session lifecycle
- Tracks user location and device orientation through a combination of
  ARKit or ARCore and the device's GPS and other sensors
- Provides access to a `SceneView` to display your GIS 3D data over the live
  camera feed
- Provides the `screenToLocation` method to convert a screen point to a
  real-world coordinate
- Eases access to all ARKit or ARCore and `LocationDataSource` delegate
  methods

## Creating a new AR application using ArcGIS Runtime AR toolkit

### Creating a new C++ application

An example C++ application with AR support can be found in the folder
`Examples\AR\CppArExample` in the toolkit repo.

Note: In the following explanation, `<ProjectName>` refers to the project name
used to create the Qt project.

1. Install the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt. See
[ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/qml/guide/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-qt.htm)
for details.

2. Download from GitHub the source files of the
[ArcGIS Runtime API Toolkit](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt).

3. In Qt Creator, create a new project and select the app template named
"ArcGIS Runtime 100.6 Qt Quick C++ app". Select the option "3D project" in the
"Details" dialog.

4. In the newly created project, add the following lines anywhere in the app's project (`.pro`)
file, making sure to use the correct path to the ArcGIS Toolkit source folder
on your development machine.

```
AR_TOOLKIT_SOURCE_PATH = # must be set to the path to toolkit sources
include($$AR_TOOLKIT_SOURCE_PATH/Plugin/CppApi/ArCppApi.pri)
```

5. In the `main.cpp` file, make the following changes:

  - Set the environment variable `QSG_RENDER_LOOP` to `basic` in the beginning of the `main` function. See [Note for performance issues] for details.

```
#if defined(Q_OS_IOS) || defined(Q_OS_ANDROID)
  qputenv("QSG_RENDER_LOOP", "basic");
#endif
```

  - Include the header `ArcGISArView.h`.
```
#include "ArcGISArView.h"
```

  -  Call the `ArcGISArView::qmlRegisterTypes()` before the creation of the QML
  engine, to register with the QML engine the`ArcGISArView` and
  `LocationDataSource` C++ classes . This is necessary to allow you to create
  objects of these types in QML.
```
Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit::ArcGISArView::qmlRegisterTypes();
```

6. In the `<ProjectName>.h` file, add a new property to access the AR view:
```
#include "ArcGISArView.h"
...

class <ProjectName> : public QObject
{
  Q_OBJECT
  Q_PROPERTY(Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit::ArcGISArView* arcGISArView READ arcGISArView WRITE setArcGISArView
             NOTIFY arcGISArViewChanged)
  ...

signals:
  void arcGISArViewChanged();
  ...

private:
  Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit::ArcGISArView* arcGISArView() const;
  void setArcGISArView(Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit::ArcGISArView* arcGISArView);

  Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit::ArcGISArView* m_arcGISArView = nullptr;
  ...
};
```

7. In the `<ProjectName>.cpp` file, implement the setter and getter for the
`arcGISArView` property. In the setter, set the properties `originCamera`,
`translationFactor`, and `setLocationDataSource`.
An example of settings for world-scale mode is given in the following code.
```
using namespace Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit;
...

ArcGISArView* <ProjectName>::arcGISArView() const
{
  return m_arcGISArView;
}

void <ProjectName>::setArcGISArView(ArcGISArView* arcGISArView)
{
  if (!arcGISArView || arcGISArView == m_arcGISArView)
    return;

  m_arcGISArView = arcGISArView;

  // full scale mode
  m_arcGISArView->setOriginCamera(Camera());
  m_arcGISArView->setTranslationFactor(1.0);
  m_arcGISArView->setLocationDataSource(new LocationDataSource(this));

  emit arcGISArViewChanged();
}
```

An example of parameters for tabletop AR app is given in the following code:
```
  m_arcGISArView->setOriginCamera(Camera(latitude, longitude, altitude, 0.0, 90.0, 0.0));
  m_arcGISArView->setTranslationFactor(1000.0);
  m_arcGISArView->setLocationDataSource(nullptr);
```

In the constructor of the app's root class, adapt the creation of the scene.
The default scene is suitable for full scale mode.

8. In the `<ProjectName>Form.qml` file,  make the following changes:

  - Import the AR toolkit:
```
import Esri.ArcGISArToolkit 1.0
```

  - Create an AR view in the back of the `SceneView` (then before the declaration of `SceneView` in the QML file):
```
ArcGISArView {
    id: arcGISArView
    anchors.fill: parent
    sceneView: view
    tracking: true
}
```

  - In the declaration of `<ProjectName>` component, bind the AR view to the `arcGISArView` property:
```
<ProjectName> {
    id: model
    arcGISArView: arcGISArView
    ...
```

### Creating a new QML application with AR support

An example of QML application with AR support can be found in the folder
`Examples\AR\QmlArExample` in the toolkit repo.

1. Install the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt. See
[ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt Guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/qml/guide/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-qt.htm)
for details.

2. Download the sources of the [ArcGIS Runtime API Toolkit](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt) from GitHub.

3. In Qt Creator, create a new project and select "ArcGIS Runtime 100.6 Qt Quick QML app".
Select the option "3D project" in the "Details" step.

4. In the created project, add the following lines anywhere in the app's project
(`.pro`) file. Make sure to set the correct path to the ArcGIS Toolkit source
folder.

```
AR_TOOLKIT_SOURCE_PATH = # must be set to the path to toolkit sources
include($$AR_TOOLKIT_SOURCE_PATH/Plugin/QmlApi/ArQmlApi.pri)
```

5. In the `main.cpp` file, make the following changes:

  - Set the environment variable `QSG_RENDER_LOOP` to `basic` in the beginning of the `main` function.
See [Note for performance issues] for details.
```
#if defined(Q_OS_IOS) || defined(Q_OS_ANDROID)
  qputenv("QSG_RENDER_LOOP", "basic");
#endif
```

  - Include the header `QmlArcGISArView.h`.
```
#include "QmlArcGISArView.h"
```

  - Call the `QmlArcGISArView::qmlRegisterTypes()` before the creation of the QML engine, to register the
`ArcGISArView` and `LocationDataSource` QML types in QML engine. This is necessary to create a object
of these types in QML.
```
Esri::ArcGISRuntime::Toolkit::QmlArcGISArView::qmlRegisterTypes();
```

6. In the `main.qml` file,  make the following changes:

  - Import the AR toolkit:
```
import Esri.ArcGISArToolkit 1.0
```

  - Create an AR view before the declaration of `SceneView` in the QML file.
The following code show an example of initialization for the properties `originCamera`, `translationFactor` and
`locationDataSource`used for world-scale mode.
```
ArcGISArView {
    id: arcGISArView
    anchors.fill: parent
    tracking: true
    sceneView: sceneView
    originCamera: Camera {}
    locationDataSource: LocationDataSource {}
    translationFactor: 1.0
}
```

The following code show an example for tabletop mode.
```
originCamera: Camera {
    location: Point {
        y: latitude
        x: longitude
        z: altitude
    }
    heading: 0.0
    pitch: 90.0
    roll: 0.0
}
locationDataSource: null
translationFactor: 1000.0
```

## AR frameworks configuration

All the files necessary to build an ArcGIS application with AR support are
provided in the AR toolkit. To deploy the application on Android and iOS
devices, extra steps are needed to give necessary permissions to the
application.

### Configuration for iOS devices

1. In the `Info.plist` file, add the following key at the end of the file,
just before `</dict>`. This gives ARKit access to the device's camera.

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera access is needed for AR testing</string>
```

See [Apple's documentation for NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription?language=objc) for details.

2. The project is now ready to be build and run in a compatible iOS device.
ARKit requires an iOS or iPadOS device with iOS 11 and an A9 processor or later.
The list of compatible devices can be found in the end of the
[Augmented Reality page](https://www.apple.com/lae/ios/augmented-reality/).

### Configuration for Android devices

For details about `ARCore` configuration, see [Google's ARCore documentation](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/c/enable-arcore).

1. In Qt Creator, make these changes to the project:

  - Open the "Projects" mode (in the left toolbar) and select an Android kit.

  - In the "Build Settings" then "Build Android APK", click on the "Create
  template" button. (`AndroidManifest.xml` and "gradle" files are added to the
  project.)

2. In the file `AndroidManifest.xml`, make the following changes using a plain text editor (right-click
on the filename and select "Open With" then "Plain Text Editor").

  - Under the line `<!-- Application arguments -->`, add the following line to
enable ARCore support.
```
<meta-data android:name="com.google.ar.core" android:value="required"/>
```

The value can be `optional` or `required`. An AR optional application can be
installed and run on devices that don't support `ARCore`, and the `Google Play
Services for AR` is not automatically installed with the app. An AR required
application is available only on devices that support `ARCore`, and `Google
Play Services for AR` is automatically installed with the app.

For details, see [Enable ARCore documentation](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/enable-arcore#manifest).

  - Under the line `<!-- %%INSERT_FEATURES -->`, add the following line to give
permission to access the camera to ARCore.
```
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.ar" android:required="true"/>
```

  - Set the minimum SDK version `android:minSdkVersion` to 24 for AR required application and 14 for
AR optional application.
```
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="24" android:targetSdkVersion="28"/>
```

3. In the `build.gradle` file, in `dependencies`, add the ARCore dependency:
```
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar', '*.aar'])
    implementation 'com.google.ar:core:1.11.0'
}
```

4. The project is now ready to be build and run in a compatible Android device. 

ARCore requires Android 7.0 or later. The list of compatible devices can be found in
[ARCore supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)

## Note for performance issues

There are some conflicts between the AR frameworks and Qt's rendering thread.
See the [SceneView::renderFrame](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/cpp/api-reference/esri-arcgisruntime-sceneview.html#renderFrame) API documentation and
[Qt's documentation about non-threaded render loops](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#non-threaded-render-loops-basic-and-windows)
for more information.

The following lines of code enable the non-threaded render loop mode in Qt:

```
#if defined(Q_OS_IOS) && defined(Q_OS_ANDROID)
  qputenv("QSG_RENDER_LOOP", "basic");
#endif
```
