Defines a small "overview" (or "inset") map displaying a representation of the current viewpoint of the given GeoView. For MapViews, the current viewpoint will be represented by a polygon displaying the visible area of the MapView. For SceneViews, the current viewpoint will be represented by a reticle (cross-hairs) displaying the viewpoint center.
