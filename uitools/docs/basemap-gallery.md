# Basemap Gallery

The BasemapGallery displays a collection of items representing basemaps from either ArcGIS Online, a user-defined portal, or an array of Basemaps. When the user selects a basemap from the BasemapGallery, the basemap rendered in the current geoModel is removed from the given map/scene and replaced with the basemap selected in the gallery.
