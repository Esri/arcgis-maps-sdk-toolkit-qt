# BasemapGallery - Qt Quick UI control/QML Type

The [BasemapGallery - Qt Quick UI control/QML Type](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/toolkit/api-reference/qml-basemapgallery.html) displays a collection of items representing basemaps from either ArcGIS Online, a user-defined portal, or an array of Basemaps. When the user selects a basemap from the BasemapGallery, the basemap rendered in the current geoModel is removed from the given map/scene and replaced with the basemap selected in the gallery.
