# NorthArrow - Qt Quick UI/QML Type

The [NorthArrow - Qt Quick UI/QML Type](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/toolkit/api-reference/qml-northarrow.html) displays a compass overlaid on the GeoView, with the compass heading matching the current rotation of the MapView, or Camera heading of the SceneView. Double clicking on the NorthArrow triggers the heading of the connected GeoView to be orientainted to 0.

NOTE: default width and height is 48 pixels.
