# Callout - Qt Quick UI control/QML Type

The [Callout - Qt Quick UI control/QML Type](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/toolkit/api-reference/qml-callout.html) is a view for displaying information at a geographic location on a Map. A Callout can be displayed for several different scenarios:

- To display the coordinates where a user tapped on the map.
- To display information about a GeoElement that has been identified on the MapView.
- To display a callout at your current location.

For more information, please see the CalloutData documentation.
